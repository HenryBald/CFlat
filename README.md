## Outline for CSharp - Santhosh 
* Our idea for a application is a music creation app that allows the user to recreate sounds of a instrument of their choice which will be be implemmented homescreen and we will have a few options for instruments such as one for prcussion, piano located in the homescreen and when the user hovers over an instrument it will take them to a new place that has the instrument and intructions on how to make the sound.
* We think we can implement the sound aspect of this using keycodes such as the ones used in the calculator app so each key represents a sound
- For example a piano that inputs each sound when you press the specific key
